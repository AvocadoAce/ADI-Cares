                                <h2>The mum who left her medical career to support caregivers of special needs kids</h2>
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                                    “I thought I was going to die,” says Dr Lim Hong Huay, 51, recalling the time when she was 
                                    suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pregnant with her first child 
                                    in 2003. “I asked myself then what I would give my life for, and I realised that my family 
                                    actually means a lot to me,” she says, adding that she and her unborn baby survived the ordeal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The former developmental and behavioural paediatrician, 51, is married to Dr Leong Hoe Nam, 
                                    an infectious diseases physician. They have three children: Marianne, 20; Vivianne, 15; and 
                                    Lucas, 13. Her eldest and youngest children have autism.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Changing priorities</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Dr Lim gave up her career at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital in 2017, when the reality sank 
                                    in that she could not keep up with her three children and the demands of her work. She ended 
                                    up devoting herself completely to her children, much to the detriment of her personal 
                                    relationship with her husband.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “I realised that looking after your family is also about looking after your relationship with 
                                    your spouse, because the best gift you can give to your children is a happy marriage,” she says.
                                </p>
                                <p>As her children grew up, the dynamics of her family changed. Having a more direct and authoritative 
                                    approach (for instance, to keep them safe) used to work in their early years, but it became clear to 
                                    her that she needed to change the way she related to them as they matured.
                                </p>
                                <p>“It’s no longer what I want that is important, but rather, what they want and how I can support them,” 
                                    she explains.
                                </p>
                                <p>It also dawned on her that it was just as important to focus on herself. She once joined a support 
                                    group when caregiving duties took a toll on her. However, instead of receiving support, she found 
                                    herself trying to attend to other members seeking advice when they knew she was a doctor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    She was touched when the group’s leader reminded everyone that she, too, was a mother, and that 
                                    every caregiver is a person. From that moment, she came to understand the importance of treasuring 
                                    her own personhood.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “I had lost myself to serving as a mother, and I needed to build up myself so that I’d be able to 
                                    love my children better. If I was so unhappy with myself, how was I going to make my family happy? 
                                    We can only love others if we love ourselves,” she shares.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That learning point has helped Dr Lim to serve many families since she founded CaringSG, a 
                                    non-profit initiative to support caregivers of persons with special needs, four years ago.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    CaringSG offers three programmes: Carebuddy, which pairs trained caregiving volunteers with other 
                                    caregivers for support; Careconnect, which provides emotional support, resources, and connections 
                                    through webinars and events; and Carewell, which connects caregivers with trained professionals to 
                                    create a family support plan.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “What drives me are the caregivers of special needs children. Despite the challenges and 
                                    discrimination, they rise above that, and do whatever they can to better the future for their children 
                                    and families,“ she says.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the past year, the organisation engaged 6,000 participants in webinars and events, established 260 
                                    touch points with over 250 volunteers, co-organised three national carnivals, hosted conferences, and 
                                    participated in the Purple Parade, an annual gathering that celebrates the abilities of people with 
                                    disabilities.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “My eldest daughter, Marianne, is involved in the Purple Symphony Choir. The kids also help out at 
                                    Purple Parade events every year, as much as they can,“ she shares.
                                </p><br>
                                <h3>Building blocks of a loving family</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Strong commitment, effective communication and remarkable courage are qualities that strengthen a family.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Love is a choice that I make to be with you, no matter what you do or what you can give me. This 
                                    commitment is why my family has been able to weather all our ups and downs,” she explains.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When miscommunication leads to unhappiness, she finds that a dose of patience, forgiveness, respect 
                                    or humour is necessary to keep the peace.
                                </p>   
                                <p>
                                    Dr Lim feels that what works for one family may not work for another, but having the courage to 
                                    move forward when a situation crops up at home is important. “Never mind mistakes, because we can 
                                    learn from them. Just be brave and try,” she says.
                                </p>   
                                <p>
                                    She also believes that being courageous to try something new can uplift loved ones, such as 
                                    the time when her husband picked up cycling – at 50 years old – just so he could partake in her 
                                    love for cycling with her.
                                </p>   
                                <p>
                                    “That’s what I mean by being courageous for one another,” she says.
                                </p>
